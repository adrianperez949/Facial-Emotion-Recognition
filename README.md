# Facial-Emotion-Recognition
This project is developed with a pretrained model whitch use convolutional neural networks. it's used the keras library to load the model, and opencv (Cv2) to detect faces and work with the images. This proyect is able to diferenciate six facial emotions (surprise, happiness, neutral, sadness, disgusting, fear).

The models_mini_XCEPTION.78-0.64.hdf5, with .hdf5 extension, is the pretrained model that was trained wiyh ther FER2013 dataset (Taken from kaggle).
The opencv_cam2.py is the program which you have to execute to run the Facial-Emotion-Recognition.
